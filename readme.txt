This Project includes an executable musicFestival.exe, Which will provide you a log file testcase.log.

The executable will run a rest call to the REST end-point(
https://eacp.energyaustralia.com.au/codingtest/api/v1/festivals') and fetch its response.

The goal of the script is to generate a log file that will provide the information if it's a Success call or Failed call.


Please click on the executable to run the python code and as per the rest response, the log file will get updated.
That log file will contain all the scenarios of failed test cases that the dev team needs to fix from the API development.
